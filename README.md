# PokeBattle: 🥊🎮

PokeBattle is a re-incarneted 'Tekken' battle game based on the October coding Cohort at Makers Academy. PokeBattle was done with React as the front end, Rails as the back end, and the duration of this project was for a week.

## How To Use:



## Approach:



## MVP:

It was vital for us to create an MVP as we had to pinpoint what made our game unique. This was
our starting point/goal for building the project.

```
As a user,
So I can be engaged with the battle game,
I would like to see two characters on the screen
```

```
As a user,
So I can be start playing the battle game,
I would like to attack a player (and see a reaction)
```

```
As a user,
So I can be start playing the battle game,
I would like the attacked player to receive damage to their health bar  
```

## Other User Stories (That were accomplished):

Throughout the week, we branched off into accomplishing the following user stories. Although we
brainstormed many, these are the ones that were acheived during the week.
